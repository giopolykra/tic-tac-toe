## Plan To Do:
* Create an AI tic-tac-toe game with Neural Networks
* Expand to SuperTic Tac Toe with NN with two variants:
  - [ ] won sub-boards are dead and replaced with the winners marker 
  - [ ] won sub-boards are still playble until all the squares are filled
The two variants have different winning tactics
